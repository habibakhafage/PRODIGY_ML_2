# Clustering Algorithms

Clustering algorithms are powerful tools in machine learning for grouping similar data points together. In this study, we explore four popular clustering algorithms: **K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Affinity Propagation**.

## K-means Clustering
K-means is an iterative algorithm that partitions data into **K distinct clusters** based on the proximity of data points to the cluster centroids. It aims to **minimize the within-cluster sum of squares**. K-means is computationally efficient and works well when clusters are **well-separated and of similar size**. However, it requires specifying the number of clusters in advance.

## Project Overview
This project applies the **KMeans clustering algorithm** to segment customers, revealing patterns in purchasing behavior and enabling more targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Data Preparation
- Removed outliers and normalized the data for consistency.

### 2. Visual Exploration
- Created dynamic visualizations to highlight customer behaviors.

### 3. Data Scaling & PCA
- Scaled the data and applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality and enhance performance.

### 4. Cluster Optimization
- Used the **elbow method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### 5. Effective Segmentation
- Implemented **KMeans clustering** to identify key customer segments, improving marketing strategies.

### 6. Cross-Validation
- Applied cross-validation techniques to ensure model reliability and robustness.

### 7. Silhouette Analysis
- Used **silhouette scores** to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the clusters.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for efficient data handling
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning implementation
